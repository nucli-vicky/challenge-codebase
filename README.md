## 🧠 Overview

Your algorithm receives the files under `features/` for each subject and must output a pseudo-CT volume as a NIfTI file in Hounsfield units (HU). Predictions are evaluated two ways (see [Evaluation](#evaluation-srcevaluation) for metric definitions):

1. **CT accuracy** — Predicted pseudo-CT is compared directly against the ground-truth CT
2. **PET accuracy** — Predicted pseudo-CT is fed into the reconstruction pipeline to produce an attenuation-corrected PET image, which is then compared against the ground-truth PET

Note that no PET reconstruction experience is needed to participate in the challenge, and the main purpose of the reconstruction is to enable clinically meaningful metrics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Requirements:** Python 3.12, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), Docker

```bash
uv sync
```

The `src/` directory contains three components:

```
src/
├── baseline/       # Baseline pseudo-CT model (patch-based 3D UNet)
├── evaluation/     # Metric defintinitions and scripts
└── recon/          # PET reconstruction script (and Docker)
```

<a id="dataset-structure"></a>

## 🗂️ Dataset structure

The dataset comprises 99 subject-unique studies, with 20 reserved for testing and the remaining 79 available on huggingface and split as follows:

| Split | Subjects | Contents |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `train/` (full) | 8 | `features/` + `ct-label/` + `recon/` + `pet-label/` |
| `train/` (no recon) | 67 | `features/` + `ct-label/` |
| `val/` | 4 | `features/` + `recon/` |

All train subjects have CT labels, but due to the size of the sinograms, only 8 include the `recon/` and `pet-label/` folders needed for closed loop reconstruction. Validation subjects have sinogram `recon/` data but no labels — submit predicted pseudo-CTs and reconstructed PETs to Codabench to get live leaderboard metrics during the challenge. The train subjects with `recon/` data are: `sub-000, sub-001, sub-002, sub-005, sub-006, sub-008, sub-013, sub-014`.


All images except those in `pet-label` are resampled to the label CT image (tensor size: 512x512x531, voxel size 1.52x1.52,2.00mm^3). NIfTI images are structured in four folders per subject. 
- `features/` All the files you can use as input to your pseudo-CT model during inference.
- `ct-label/` The CT target (`ct.nii.gz`) and segmentations for evaluation. 
- `pet-label/` The PET target (`pet.nii.gz`) and segmentations for evaluation. 
- `recon/` Sinograms and metadata for PET reconstructions.

## 📦 Pseudo-CT Baseline (`src/baseline/`)

A simple patch-based 3D UNet that predicts pseudo-CT from NAC-PET only. 

**Python usage:**

```bash
# Example:
python src/baseline/predict.py --features_dir data/sub-000/features/ --output_ct results/sub-000/ct.nii.gz
```

**Docker usage:**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/bic-mac-challenge/baseline:latest

docker run --rm \
  --gpus all \
  -v /path/to/sub-000/features:/data/features:ro \
  -v /path/to/output:/data/output \
  ghcr.io/bic-mac-challenge/baseline:latest
```

The predicted CT is written to `/data/output/ct.nii.gz`. All weights and dependencies are baked into the image, and the same is expected for your final docker image submission.

You can re-train the baseline by running `train.py` and containerize it by running `docker build -t my-baseline .` (from inside the `src/baseline` folder)

## ⚙️ Reconstruction (`src/recon/`)

Converts a CT (ground-truth or pseudo-CT) and PET sinograms into an attenuation-corrected PET image using [STIR](http://stir.sourceforge.net/). See [docs/reconstruction.md](docs/reconstruction.md) for pipeline details and local usage instructions.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/bic-mac-challenge/recon:latest

docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/sub-000/recon:/data/recon \
  -v /path/to/ct.nii.gz:/data/ct/ct.nii.gz \
  -v /path/to/output:/data/output \
  ghcr.io/bic-mac-challenge/recon:latest
```

The reconstructed PET is written to `/data/output/pet.nii.gz`.

> [!WARNING]
> Running reconstruction requires **~20 GB of RAM** and takes **20–120 minutes** depending on CPU speed. The `intermediates/` folder uses **~50 GB** of additional disk space — consider deleting it after a successful reconstruction.

## 📊 Evaluation (`src/evaluation/`)

Five metrics compare predicted PET and CT outputs against the ground truth:

| Metric | Modality | Description | Region |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| Whole-body SUV MAE | `PET` | Mean absolute error in standardised uptake value (SUV = activity × weight / total dose) | Body mask, excluding ±4 cm around liver |
| Brain Outlier Score | `PET` | AUC of fraction of brain voxels within relative error thresholds (5%, 10%, 15%) | Brain |
| Organ Bias | `PET` | Mean absolute relative error of mean SUV in 8 organs: brain, liver, spleen, heart, pancreas, muscle, adipose, extremities | TotalSegmentator organ labels |
| CT MU MAE | `CT` | Mean absolute error of attenuation coefficients (μ at 511 keV) between predicted and ground-truth CT after HU→μ conversion | Body mask, excluding ±4 cm axial slices at top of liver|
| TAC Bias | `Dynamic PET` | Absolute relative error of the integral of time-activity-curves (TACs) for the aorta and selected brain regions. NOTE: Metric is computed only for the final test set due to the size of the dynamic sinograms. | Brain regions and aorta|

**Evaluate a single subject:**

```bash
python src/evaluation/eval_subject.py \
  --subject_dir <subject_dir> \
  --pred_pet <pred_pet.nii.gz> \
  --pred_ct <pred_ct.nii.gz>
```

`--pred_pet` and `--pred_ct` are both optional — omit either to skip PET or CT metrics.
Note: Brain Outlier Score is a dataset-level metric and requires multiple subjects (see below).

**Evaluate multiple subjects:**

```bash
python src/evaluation/eval_dataset.py \
  --dataset_dir <dataset_dir> \
  --pred_dir <predictions_dir>
```

`<predictions_dir>` must contain one sub-folder per subject with consistent contents — either CT only, PET only, or both:

```
predictions_dir/
├── sub-000/
│   ├── ct.nii.gz        
│   └── pet.nii.gz       
├── sub-001/
│   ├── ct.nii.gz
│   └── pet.nii.gz
└── ...
```

<a id="submission"></a>

## 📬 Submission

| Phase | What you submit |
|-------|----------------|
| **Validation** | Zip of NIfTI predictions for the 4 `val/` subjects (CT + optional PET) uploaded to Codabench — you run prediction and reconstruction locally using the provided data and tools |
| **Dry Run** | Docker container emailed to us — we run it on the 4 `val/` subjects on our hardware and return CT metrics, or error logs if the container failed |
| **Final Test** | Docker container emailed to us — we run prediction, reconstruction, and full evaluation on the unseen test set |

Validation and Dry Run open May 15. See [docs/submission-guide.md](docs/submission-guide.md) for full instructions, and [docs/docker-packaging.md](docs/docker-packaging.md) for how to build and test your container.
